## Feline Flexbox - Challenge Mew 🐈

- Add [CSS flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to your elements to make them sit next to each other (horizontally) on the page. Three or four across on Desktop should look good. They should then stack on top of each other (wrap) the smaller our screen size gets.

Hint: You'll need to target the parent container for your cat cards with `display: flex;`

Top tip: add temporary borders around your parent and child containers. This will help you identify what's what 👍

- Don't forget to test how your page looks on different screen sizes using your browser tools! If you need help on toggling the device view, ask one of the Tech Coaches to help 🙂

Note: Flexbox can be challenging, so don't worry if it takes a while to get it right. If you get stuck this [flexbox froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) tutorial should help 🐸 


If your cats are playing nicely and stacking in mobile - you're ready for [Activity-3](./activity-3.md)!
