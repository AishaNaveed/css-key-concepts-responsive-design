------

Welcome to Feline Flexbox with Cat Cards!

Follow the instructions in this Read Me to create your very own, feline flexy, responsive Cat page!

# Step 1

- Open your html document in the browser

Right click your index.html page and select 'open in...' then select browser. Alternatively type 'open index.html' in your terminal and press enter.

You should now see a collection of cute cat pictures
-- notice how our elements stretch accross the page in a 'normal flow'. These are block level, in-line elements 


What is first thing we need to do?
- add a css reset (create separate file?)
-- notice how your elements change, we have removed browser styles from our elements!


The blah people at blah blah need a website designing to...
- cards 
- messy - how can we arrange these so they look nicer on the page?
- Add CSS flexbox to your elements to make them sit x across the page, and stack on top of each other the smaller our web page gets
- Don't forget to test in your browser using inspect

Once cards are sitting nicely
- Using fluid units of measurement can we change our text so it grows and shrinks to different screen sizes?

The people at blah blah have decided they don't want X element to be visible on mobile
- Using media queries, remove X item from the page on pages smaller than 600px wide
- Using media queries, make the page change colour for different size screens 

Extension
- Add a title to your page using a Google font
- Add a navbar to your page (make sure it's responsive)
--- Think about how these should look on mobile vs on desktop
- Add a media querie that checks what screen preferences a user has, if they prefer dark mode update your design to use dark mode
