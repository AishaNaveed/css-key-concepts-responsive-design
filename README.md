# CSS Key Concepts: Responsive Design 

- CSS reset

- Fluid vs fixed units

- Media Queries

- Flex box 


------

- Open your html document in the browser
-- notice how our elements stretch accross the page in a 'normal flow'. These are block level, in-line elements 


What is first thing we need to do?
- add a css reset (create separate file?)
-- notice how your elements change, we have removed browser styles from our elements!


The blah people at blah blah need a website designing to...
- cards 
- messy - how can we arrange these so they look nicer on the page?
- Add CSS flexbox to your elements to make them sit x across the page, and stack on top of each other the smaller our web page gets
- Don't forget to test in your browser using inspect

Once cards are sitting nicely
- Using fluid units of measurement can we change our text so it grows and shrinks to different screen sizes?

The people at blah blah have decided they don't want X element to be visible on mobile
- Using media queries, remove X item from the page on pages smaller than 600px wide
- Using media queries, make the page change colour for different size screens 

Extension
- Add a title to your page using a Google font
- Add a navbar to your page (make sure it's responsive)
--- Think about how these should look on mobile vs on desktop
- Add a media querie that checks what screen preferences a user has, if they prefer dark mode update your design to use dark mode
